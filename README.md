# pr-euler
Attempts to resolve ProjectEuler.net problems.

## Disclaimer

I'm *completely* not sure if they work.
It is a set of old programs attempting to resolve the problems in https://projecteuler.net.
I wrote the programs a long time ago, and didn't log the results of the algorithms.

I believe most of them do work. Some can be incomplete, and some are not fast enough.
My project is to modularize all the programs, and change it to js instead of C, since I work mostly with js recently, and I can see some ways to be better coded.
